# CryptoEncoders

CryptoEncoders its a simple python software automated to encode words, sentences or passwords to back them into a hash...

The result of the hash depends on the next things:

1. The characters/text that you put on the first input 
2. And the algoritm that you specify on the second input

(For example)
After execute the command python3 coders.py youre gonna see this small informative banner...

In the first entry you have to put the password, text or sentence that you want for example...

The final and second entry input its gonna ask you what algoritm you want to encode youre password, text or sentence...

In this case i put sha512 algoritm...

When you do it the before steps the software gonna dump you the final result of youre password, text or sentence encoded with the hash algoritm that you selected...
